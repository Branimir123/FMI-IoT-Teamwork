#### SmartHive is a platform for beehive monitoring developed as a course project in Internet Of Things @ Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski"

-------------------------------------
### The board

#### As a main board we use the ESP8266 based Wemos D1 mini which has wifi and is easy to program in the Arduino IDE

### The sensors

#### Currently we only use one sensor - BME280, which measures temperature and humidity, but our plan is to connect more sensors in the future and add additional functionality
